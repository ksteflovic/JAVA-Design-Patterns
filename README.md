# JAVA Design Patterns
## Gang of Four Design Patterns
Which **GOF** design patterns contains this repository?
### [Creational Design Patterns](Creational%20Design%20Patterns)
- ***Abstract Factory*** -> *Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type*.
- ***Builder*** -> *Uses to create complex objects*.
- ***Factory Method*** -> *Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create*.
- ***Prototype*** -> *Creates a new object from an existing object*.
- ***Singleton*** -> *Ensures only one instance of an object is created*.

### [Structural Design Patterns](Structural%20Design%20Patterns)
- ***Adapter*** -> *Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by adding an interface*.
- ~~Bridge~~.
- ***Composite*** -> *Takes a group of objects into a single object*.
- ***Decorator*** -> *Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time*.
- ***Facade*** -> *Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object*.
- ~~Flyweight~~.
- ~~Proxy~~.

### [Behavior Design Patterns](Behavior%20Design%20Patterns)
- ~~Chain of Responsibility~~.
- ***Command*** -> *Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters*.
- ~~Interpreter~~.
- ***Iterator*** -> *Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation*.
- ~~Mediator~~.
- ~~Memento~~.
- ***Observer*** -> *Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event*.
- ~~State~~.
- ***Strategy*** -> *Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time*.
- ***Template Method*** -> *Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior*.
- ~~Visitor~~.
