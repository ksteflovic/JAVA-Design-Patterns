# Design pattern - *Composite*

> Composite is a ***structural design pattern*** that allows composing objects into a tree-like structure and work with the it as if it was a singular object.

The Composite Design Pattern was a pattern that made sense to do alongside the Iterator pattern, that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the most useful when used alongside the Iterator pattern, so I have carried on and introduced it with the *restaurant example* that I previously implemented with the [**Iterator pattern**](https://github.com/pajka-js/DP_Iterator).

This repository contains **one** assignment made in *Composite* design pattern.

## üç¥ Restaurant
Just the same as the [Iterator example](https://github.com/pajka-js/DP_Iterator), but in **Composite**. And yes, I am too lazy to make another description.
