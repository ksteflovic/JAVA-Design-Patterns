This repository contains **one** assignment done in *Iterator design pattern*.

## üç¥ Restaurant
There is one restaurant with different menus:
- Pancake menu
- Dinner menu

In the restaurant, there is a waitress. This [```Waitress.java```](https://github.com/pajka-js/DP_Iterator/blob/master/src/restaurant/Waitress.java) have to remember all menu objects in one list. After calling the waitress void ```printMenu()``` we get the output of the menu. See final output below.
